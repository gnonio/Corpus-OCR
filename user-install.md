> The temporary installation of an extension doesn’t fully mimic the behavior of a signed extension.
> For example, if the extension makes installation time permission requests, these are not displayed as part of the temporary installation process.
> Also, features, such as local storage, persist even if the extension is removed and the browser restarted.

This will suffice to try out korporize.
